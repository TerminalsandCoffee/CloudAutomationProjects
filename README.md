# CloudAutomationProjects

Welcome to the Cloud Automation Projects repository! This collection showcases a variety of scripts designed to automate tasks on Windows and Linux machines using Bash, PowerShell, and Python. 

These scripts are inspired and sanitized by real-world scenarios encountered in my day-to-day work as a Cloud Engineer.

- **AWS Automation**: Scripts for managing AWS resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM users, and more.
